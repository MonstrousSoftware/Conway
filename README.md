# Conway

Experiment to try out compute shaders based on a demo from LWJGL3.

1. Demo rewritten to make use of LibGDX functionality. (work in progress)
2. Requires the use of a custom LibGDX that exposes the necessary gl calls

* Based on LWJGL3 demo by Kai Burjack
* https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-demos/blob/main/src/org/lwjgl/demo/opengl/shader/GameOfLife.java
